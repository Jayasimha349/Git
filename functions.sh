#functions

#In the functions we declare the function and call the funnction
#In the function we will not use exit command beacause it exits completely from the function instead we uses return command to come out of the function
#If we will give return command in the middle of the function it comes out from the function immediatley after it encounters the return command
#Variables in the function we can acess variables in the function in the main program and vice versa.
#if we declare variable inside the function and gives the local the we can acess it only in the function.
